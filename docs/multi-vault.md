# Multi-Vault Setup

By default obsidian-mcp serves one vault (`VAULT_PATH`). If you need several
completely separate vaults from one deployment — e.g. a private vault and a
work vault, each only reachable by its own identity — set `VAULTS_CONFIG` to
the path of a JSON file instead. Vault path-policy settings (`VAULT_PATH`,
`READ_PATHS`, `WRITE_PATHS`, `DENY_READ_PATHS`, `DENY_WRITE_PATHS`, and
`EXCLUDE_PATHS`) and identity settings (`API_KEY` and
`OAUTH_GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGINS`) then come from that file. See
[`vaults.json.example`](../vaults.json.example):

```json
{
  "vaults": {
    "private": {"path": "/vaults/private", "exclude_paths": ["private/", ".obsidian/", ".trash/"]},
    "monari":  {"path": "/vaults/monari",  "write_paths": ["02-Areas/monari/"]}
  },
  "identities": [
    {"type": "api_key",      "value": "sk-...",              "vaults": ["private"]},
    {"type": "github_login", "value": "your-github-username", "vaults": ["private", "monari"], "default": "private"}
  ]
}
```

Each vault entry can set `read_paths`, `write_paths`, `deny_read_paths`,
`deny_write_paths`, `exclude_paths`, and `read_only` independently. Path
rules are rooted: a trailing slash includes descendants, while a rule
without one matches only that exact path. `exclude_paths` controls
discovery/indexing; the read/write/deny fields are the access-control
boundary.

```env
VAULT_PATH=              # unused — vaults.json defines paths instead
VAULTS_CONFIG=/data/vaults.json
TRANSPORT=http
```

Multi-vault mode requires an authenticated network transport (`http`, `sse`,
or `streamable-http`). It cannot be used with `stdio`, because stdio has no
authenticated request identity to map to a vault.

Each `identities` entry is either an **API key** (`Authorization: Bearer
<value>`, same as [Option A](remote-setup.md#option-a-api-key-claude-code-claude-desktop-curl-mcp-remote))
or a **GitHub login** (same allowlist mechanism as
[Option B](remote-setup.md#option-b-github-oauth-claudeai-webmobile-custom-connector) —
set `OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`/`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` as usual, just skip
`OAUTH_GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGINS` since `vaults.json` replaces it). Both kinds
can be mixed and used at the same time. Whichever identity a request
authenticates as, every tool call is transparently scoped to that identity's
vault(s) — there is no way to reach a vault an identity isn't listed for.

An identity with more than one entry in `"vaults"` can switch between them:
every tool accepts an optional `vault=<name>` argument for that one call. If
omitted, it uses the identity's configured `"default"`; an identity with
several vaults and no default must pass `vault=` explicitly.
`list_vaults_tool()` returns `[{name, description, is_default}]`
for whichever identity is calling, so an MCP client can discover what it's
allowed to pass — the built-in instructions tell Claude to call it first
and pass `vault=` when the conversation clearly points at a non-default
vault. There's no server-side memory of which vault was picked last; it's
re-selected on every call, same as any other argument.

`/attachments/*` (the direct binary upload/download route) is fully
multi-vault-aware: a plain `Authorization: Bearer` request resolves to that
identity's default vault, or pass `?vault=<name>` in the URL to pick a
different one of its allowed vaults (same rule as the `vault=` tool
argument). `create_attachment_token_tool`'s short-lived scoped tokens
(`?exp=&sig=`) work too, signed against the calling identity's own key and
bound to a specific vault — but only for **api_key** identities, since a
GitHub login has no static secret of its own to sign with; use a plain
`Authorization: Bearer` request for those instead.

> **Known limitation:** `/health` doesn't go through per-request auth/vault
> resolution — it always reports on the first vault listed in
> `vaults.json`, regardless of which identity would be calling. It exposes
> no vault content either way (just process liveness), so this doesn't leak
> anything.
